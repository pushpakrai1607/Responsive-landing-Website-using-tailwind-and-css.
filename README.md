<b>  This challenge will be a great test for your responsive skills. There are lots of small details and slight content shifts for different screen sizes. </b>

<p>
Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
See all testimonials in a horizontal slider
Receive an error message when the newsletter sign up form is submitted if:
The input field is empty
The email address is not formatted correctly
Download the starter code and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project. The style-guide.md file is where you'll find colors, fonts, etc.
